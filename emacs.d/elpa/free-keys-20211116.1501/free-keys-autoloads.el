Display free keys in current buffer.

A free key is a key that has no associated key-binding as
determined by function `key-binding'.

By default, keys on `free-keys-keys' list with no prefix sequence
are considered, possibly together with modifier keys from
`free-keys-modifiers'.  You can change the prefix sequence by
hitting 'p' in the *Free keys* buffer.  Prefix is supplied in
format recognized by `kbd', for example \"C-x\".
