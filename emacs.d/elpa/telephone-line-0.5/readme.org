* Features

Telephone Line is a new implementation of Powerline for emacs with
*(optional) baked-in evil support*, *antialiased separators*, and an
*easy configuration language* which makes it *trivial to write your
own themes*. Additionally, I *dogfood the hell out of it* so bugfixes
should come quickly. It's also *[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77R1Wp6Y_5Y][named after a song]]* which is what I
always look for in software.

* Installation

The easiest way to install telephone-line is with package.el through
MELPA. Once you have the package installed, initializing it is the
usual stuff:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'telephone-line)
(telephone-line-mode 1)
#+end_src

There is also a perfectly flat vertical separator,
~telephone-line-flat~, though there's not much to look at here ;)

* Configuration

First, remember that all configuration must be done *before* calling
~(telephone-line-mode 1)~

Segments can be added by configuring the ~telephone-line-lhs~ and
~telephone-line-rhs~ variables. Example configuration demonstrating
the format can be found in [[./examples.org]], and available segments are
in [[./telephone-line-segments.el]]. You can also make your own!

Separators are chosen by configuring
~telephone-line-primary-left-separator~,
~telephone-line-primary-right-separator~,
~telephone-line-secondary-left-separator~, and
~telephone-line-secondary-right-separator~. Available separators are
in [[./telephone-line-separators.el]]. You can also make your own!

You can force the height of the mode-line by setting
~telephone-line-height~.

If you want to further information on configuration or creating your
own segments/separators, continue on to [[./configuration.org]]!
