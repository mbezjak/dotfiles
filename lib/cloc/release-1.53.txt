New Languages:
    o Go
    o MXML

New options:

  --lang-no-ext
      o Alternate method to count files without file
        extension.
  --ignore-case  
      o Works with --diff; treat uppercase and lowercase text
        as equivalent.

Bug Fixes:

  Pascal:  Add // as a comment marker.
  IDL:     Include .pro as a recognized file extension.

  --3:   
      o Correct XSLT syle when running with --3.
  
  --diff:   
      o Implemented YAML output option.
      o Implemented XML output option.  Includes an optional
        default XSLT style file.
      o Include code/comment/blank counts of added files to  
        total added material and include code/comment/blank
        counts of removed files to total removed material.
      o Ignore unrecognized languages.
  
  --exclude-ext
      o Was inadvertently disabled in v1.52; works now.

Outstanding issues:
  --csv, --sql output formats remain unimplemented for --diff.
