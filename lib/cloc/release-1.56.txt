were added:

                Release Notes for cloc version 1.54
                   http://cloc.sourceforge.net
                          October 1, 2011


New Languages:
    o CMake
    o Cython
    o Objective C++
    o Ocaml
    o Smarty

New options and features:

  --autoconf
      o Count files of recognized languages that end with ".in"
        (for example, code.h.in, Makefile.in) as used by GNU
        automake/autoconf.

  --match-d, --not-match-d
      o Include, or skip over, directories whose names match
        provided regular expressions.

  --follow-links
      o Follow symbolic links (on Unix-like OS's).

  YAML and XML output:  header lines now include the cloc URL,
  version, # lines and files counted, etc.

  YAML and XML output:  if writing to a file (rather than STDOUT),
  save the file name as an element inside the file.

  Include support for languages with double extensions.  First
  implementation of these uses .spc.sql for SQL Stored Procedures 
  and .data.sql as SQL Data as distinct from just SQL.

  Handle archive files (tar files, zip files, etc) with spaces
  in their names.

Bug Fixes:

  Lisp:  Include .lisp as a valid file extension.

  Correctly identify operating system as Windows if MKS Toolkit is 
  installed.

  Fix incorrectly handled .inc files (could be PHP or Pascal).

  --counted
      o Correct output to show only files which were actually
        used to produce the code count.  Also show the output
        by language rather than by filename.

  --diff
      o Fixed null output when one input has a single file while
        the comparison input has multiple files.
      o Fixed null output when no lines of code are modified in
        common files (only entire files were added or removed).
      o Handle cases where one of the two inputs is an empty
        file or directory.

  --diff + --exclude-file-list
      o --diff now skips files defined by --exclude-file-list

  --diff + --exclude-lang
      o --diff now skips languages defined by --exclude-lang

  --diff + --xml   
      o Include user-provided xsl file name in XML --diff output.
      o XML output for --by-file and --by-file-by-lang.
  
  --diff + --csv
      o Added comma separated value output for --diff.
  
  --diff + --sum-reports
      o Can now use the --sum-reports option with --diff.

  --exclude-dir
      o Quote metacharacters when comparing directory names against 
      --exclude-dir value.

  --strip-comments
      o Do not remove blank lines if they follow lines with
        (language-dependent) continuation markers.

  --sum-reports + --list-file
      o Allow the --sum-reports option to take its inputs from
        files defined by --list-file

Outstanding issues:
  --sql output formats remain unimplemented for --diff.

New options:

  --lang-no-ext

  Pascal:  Add // as a comment marker.
  IDL:     Include .pro as a recognized file extension.

  --3:   
      o Correct XSLT syle when running with --3.

      o Implemented YAML output option.
      o Implemented XML output option.  Includes an optional
        default XSLT style file.
      o Include code/comment/blank counts of added files to  
        total added material and include code/comment/blank
        counts of removed files to total removed material.
      o Ignore unrecognized languages.
  
  --exclude-ext
      o Was inadvertently disabled in v1.52; works now.

============================================================================
                Release Notes for cloc version 1.52
                   http://cloc.sourceforge.net

New Languages:
    o Groovy
    o Scala
    o XAML

New options:

  --exclude-ext 
      o Ignore files with the given file extension.
  
  --ignore-whitespace  
      o Works with --diff; ignore whitespace in code and comments
        when computing differences.

Bug Fixes:

  Fortran:  Treat line starting with an exclamation mark as a comment.
  Cobol:    Treat page eject directive and any line with characters
            in columns 1-6 as a blank line.
  
  --diff:   
      o Fix negative value of removed blank lines.
      o Better output column alignment when running with --by-file.
      o Bug fixes when dealing with fully qualified Windows paths.
  
  --exclude-list-file  
      o Can now also include directories to ignore in the supplied 
        input file.

Other Improvements:
    o Better logic to select the file whose name identifies it as
      containing source code when the file is one of several having 
      identical contents (for example, if main.c and main.c.bak have
      identical contents, choose main.c for counting instead of 
      main.c.bak, which would be rejected because the filename
      does not match any recognized language).
    o Contents of .hg/ (Mercurial) directories are ignored.
    o On Windows: Ignore case in file name extensions.
